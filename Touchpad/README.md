## 3D CAD

This is 3D printable CAD of a single-piece alternative to the three-piece touchpad row
on Framework Laptop 16.
The best orientation to print this, is with the flat side (where the palms
would rest) on the bottom facing the printer bed.

You can directly unscrew the Touchpad Module itself and the daughterboard and screw them
into the 3D printed plastic parts.  Be careful not to over-tighten the fasteners, since
you can strip the plastic.

Make sure you align the Touchpad Module in the center of the opening.  You can do this easily
by screwing in one fastener, then flipping the assembly over, aligning it, and then holding it place,
flipping it back over, and screwing in the remaining fasteners.
